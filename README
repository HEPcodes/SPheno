This are short instructions for compiling and running the program SPheno,
version 3.1. Further details can be found in the manuals stored in the
doc directory.
Necessary requirements are a f90/f95 compiler and the (g)make utility.
The following compilers compile SPheno sucessfully:
NAG f95, INTEL ifort (version higher than 10.), g95, 
PGI pgf90, Lahey/Fujitsu Fortran 95. However, several problems have
been reported using the gfortran compiler.

                        seesaw type I
 LesHouches.in.SeesawII ...... example of an mSUGRA scenario combined with
                        seesaw type II, requires the compilation with option
                        -DSEESAWIII
 LesHouches.in.SeesawIII ..... example of an mSUGRA scenario combined with
                        seesaw type III, requires the compilation with option
                        -DSEESAWIII

The package includes also sample output data corresponding to the
input files specified above, denoted by SPheno.out.xxx and
SPheno.spc.xxx, where xxx stands for any of the models above in the
directory SPheno3.1.0/input.

II) Installation:
   1) Please adapt the Makefile according to your f90/f95 compiler. The 
      Makefile is written for the NAC f95 compiler but options have
      been included for other compilers as well.
   2) Run gmake.
      This will compile the SPheno program and put the executable in the bin 
      directory.
      To run the program, change to the input directory and enter
      ../bin/SPheno
      The output will be written to two files:
      - SPheno.spc containg all information about masses, mixing matrices,
        decay widths, branching ratios and production cross sections.
        The numbers should be identical to the ones given in the file
        SPheno.spc.mSugra provided you did not change the file 
        LesHouches.in
      - Messages.out containing warnings and error messages and it should
        be empty.
   3) The library libSPheno.a is stored in the subdirectory lib.

III) Running the program for different high scale models
 The easiest way is to copy the corresponding LesHouches.in.xxx file to
 LesHouches.in (xxx stands for the model considered, see above) and change the
 numbers according to your needs. Various models for LesHouches.in.xxx are
 in the subdirectory input. 

IV) The compilation of the RGEs for the seesaw tpye II and type III models
 is rather time consuming and can take up to one hour in the optimized mode.
 For this reason they are not included in the compilation using the
 default options. If you want to include, include the option -DSEESAWIII
 in the Makefile that is located in the src directory. In this way
 both set of RGEs are included.

V) The manuals are in the directory doc.

VI) In case of problems: please send an email to porod@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de
explaining the problem. Useful informations is in general contained in
the file Messages.out; moreover, you should provide me with the input files
used so that I can try to repeat the run and to decect the source of the 
problem.

Have fun,

Werner Porod
